## Is an IP Address Personal Data?

According to the **European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**:

> Personal data is defined as *“any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.”*

An IP address can be considered personal data **in certain circumstances**, especially when combined with other information such as browsing history. This means:

- **In some cases**, an IP address is personal data and subject to GDPR regulations.
- **In other cases**, such as the use of anonymous IPs or IPs for statistical purposes, it may **not** be considered personal data.
